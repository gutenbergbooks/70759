  <p class="drop-img">
    <span class="drop-img" style="width: 1.75em;"><img src="images/drop-t.jpg" alt='T'></span>HE
    wreck of the Sparrow-Hawk, which was discovered in 1863, may
    be justly regarded as one of the greatest curiosities of the age.
    This ship sailed from England for Virginia, in the fall of 1626,
    with a large number of emigrants. After a long passage, she went
    ashore on Cape Cod, and was there finally wrecked in a place then
    known as Potanumaquut Harbor. Details of her passage and loss, and
    the subsequent career of her passengers, have been preserved by
    contemporary historians, from whom we shall make brief extracts in the
    course of this work.</p>

  <p>From the several local histories of the Cape, the posthumous edition
    of Thoreau’s work, and an important note from Professor Agassiz, the
    public have been made aware of the continuous geological changes of
    that remarkable mass of drift, which we denominate “Cape Cod.” The
    statements of these various authors are singularly elucidated and
    confirmed by the history<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span> of “The Ancient Wreck.” The preservation and
    discovery of the Sparrow-Hawk present facts of startling interest to
    all,—but especially to those who are acquainted with the minutiæ of
    early colonial history. They have in mind, and can readily recall with
    us, the condition of the passengers, and the fate of their craft.</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Benjamin Drew</span>, Esq., of Chelsea, formerly of Plymouth, Mass.,
    who had the good fortune to see the wreck upon the beach at Orleans,
    before its removal, presents us with the following remarks, which we
    here insert as a suitable preface to the historical details:&#x2060;—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>As I stood upon the shore, surveying with my friend<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the remains
      of the vessel which crossed the ocean two hundred and forty years
      ago, imagination brought vividly before me the scenes of that early
      voyage, the wrecking of the ship, and the providential escape of
      the passengers and crew. Two hundred and forty years! yes, nearly
      that long period had elapsed from the time of its protracted
      and unsuccessful battling with the elements, and its subsequent
      submergence in these sands of Nauset; and to-day the sea,
      recovering the dominion it so long ago yielded to the land, has
      disclosed to us the hull in all its fair proportions and symmetry
      as it glided into the water from the builder’s hand, in the reign
      of James the First.</p>

    <p>The deep human sympathy which attaches to every scene where men
      have fought or suffered,—which treasures every relic of the times
      of the Pilgrims, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>invests this ancient wreck with a deep and
      abiding interest. As we behold it, we seem to see Mr. Fells, Mr.
      Sibsie, and the “many passengers” casting anxious eyes to the west;
      for it is stormy weather, and the sea is rough, and they have been
      six weeks afloat, “and have no water, nor beere, nor any woode
      left;” and there is Captain Johnston “sick and lame of ye scurvie,”
      so he can “but lye in his cabin dore and give direction;” and we
      observe that the passengers are “mad for land,” and so through
      “fear and unruliness,” compel the mariners “to stear a course
      betweene ye southwest and norwest, that they might fall in with
      some land, what soever it was, caring not.” And we recall, too, the
      wild scene, when in the night they grated on the bar of an unknown
      shore: the morning distress, when their cable parted and they beat
      over the shoal,—their joy at drifting safely on a beach with only
      the soaking of their cargo,—for they now discover that a plank has
      started, and that the oakum has left the seams. We listen with
      them to the strange voices of the red men; nor do we wonder that
      they “stand on their guard:” but hark! these red men talk English,
      and they tell of “New Plymouth” and “ye Governor.” So Mr. Fell and
      Mr. Sibsie sit in the cabin here,—this same cabin!—and write to
      the Governor; anon that worthy personage crosses the bay, bringing
      spikes and material for repairs; he steps on board, and gives his
      advice in the premises. They get a supply of corn, and repair
      their ship, intending once more to make sail for Virginia; surely
      they will find it this time! Before, “they had lost themselves
      at <span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>sea;” but now they will take a new departure, and will soon
      reach the land of their hopes. Not yet, my worthy friends,—your
      tight, “serviceable” craft, now afloat, must be driven upon the
      eastern side of the inner harbor, and hopelessly wrecked; you must
      sojourn with the Pilgrims; and the Sparrow-Hawk, giving a name to
      “Old Ship Harbor,” must lie for centuries under the sand and under
      the salt-marsh; successive generations of Doanes shall swing the
      scythe, and toss the hay, over her forgotten grave; but, in due
      time, when these rocky, wooded islands, shall have sunk</p>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="noindent">your ship shall stand revealed again,—timbers and planks all
      sound, the “occome” vanished from her seams, and “ye spikes” and
      all other iron dissolved away; but we shall find your old sandals,
      and the beef and mutton bones which you picked when you bade your
      vessel a last good-by; and we shall feel a kindred satisfaction
      in re-lighting the long-extinguished fires in these venerable
      tobacco-pipes which you forgot to take away; and we shall send
      your rudder for a while to the Exchange in State Street; and that,
      and all the timbers and planks which you feel so sorry to leave,
      we shall,—Mr. Fells, and Mr. Sibsie, and Capt. Johnston, by your
      leave,—remove to a dry locality, and there, at our leisure, explore
      the privacy of your cabin, and listen to your conversation with
      Samoset and Governor Bradford.</p>

    <p>If the “Advance,” which was shut in by Arctic ice, and abandoned
      by Elisha Kent Kane, should some day <span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>be sent adrift in a contest
      of icebergs, float into the Atlantic, and be towed into harbor, we
      can readily imagine the interest with which she would be regarded.
      If the “tossut” remained, who would not be anxious to creep
      through it into the sacred precincts so long the home of the great
      adventurer,—the abode, likewise, of Hans, and Ohlsen, and Morton,</p>

    <p class="noindent">What crowds would come from all parts to see the famous brig!

      Advance,—one which crossed the Atlantic while Boston was inhabited
      by Indians; when this continent was, indeed, the <i>new</i>
      world,—a ship which came freighted with passengers, who became, by
      force of circumstances, residents with, and, of course, friends
      of, the Pilgrim Fathers; and who long retained in their Virginia
      homes a sense of gratitude for favors received in the time of their
      trial. May those days of mutual good will return!</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Charles W. Livermore</span>, Esq., of this city, a member of the City
    Council, and <span class="smcap">Leander Crosby</span>, Esq., of Orleans, a well-known
    resident of the immediate vicinity of Old Ship Harbor, with a laudable
    desire to preserve so remarkable a relic, have removed the hull to
    Boston, and had all the parts put together in proper order by Messrs.
    <span class="smcap">Dolliver</span> and <span class="smcap">Sleeper</span>, well known and experienced
    ship-builders. Thus will be perpetuated a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span> ship which sailed the
    ocean contemporary with the Mayflower,—doubtless the only one of that
    remote age now existing on the face of the earth. Truly, a most unique
    curiosity, and well worthy the attention of all men.</p>

  <p>Mr. Livermore requested Messrs. Dolliver and Sleeper to communicate in
    writing all matters relating to the style of building, the condition of
    the hull, and any other particulars which might be of interest. Those
    gentlemen, having put planks and timbers together in their pristine
    shape, have furnished the following information in accordance with the
    request of Mr. Livermore:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <div class="smcap right">Boston, August 17, 1865.</div>
    <div class="smcap">Charles W. Livermore, Esq.</div><br>

    <p><i>Dear Sir</i>,—While putting into their original position the
      various portions of the ship so long buried at the Cape, we have,
      as you requested, taken special note of her peculiarities, &amp;c., and
      in compliance with your desire send the following statement.</p>

    <p>Notwithstanding the many years which this vessel has been exposed
      to the fury of the elements, and to the action of the shifting
      sands in which she has been buried, her outline has been remarkably
      well preserved. Only a practised mechanical eye could detect a
      little inequality in her sides, in consequence of her having had
      a heel to port. We have replaced the keel, sternpost, stern-knee,
      part of the keelson, all the floor timbers, most of the first
      futtocks and the garboard strake on the starboard side; but the
      stem and forefoot, the top timbers and deck are gone. Enough of
      her, however, remains to enable us to form a fair estimate of her
      general outline when complete. The model made by D. J. Lawlor,
      Esq., embodies our idea of her form and size.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

    <p>Her length on the keel when complete was twenty-eight feet ten
      inches, and she had great rake of stem with a curved forefoot, and
      the rake of her sternpost is four inches to the foot. The great
      rake of her stem and sternpost makes her length on deck between
      extremes about forty feet, and her depth about nine and one-half
      feet. Her forward lines are convex, her after lines sharp and
      concave, and her midship section is almost the arc of a circle.
      Her breadth of beam was about twelve feet and her sheer two and
      one-half feet, with a lively rise at both ends. She had a square
      stern, and no doubt bulwarks as far forward as the waist; but the
      outline of the rest of her decks was probably protected by an open
      rail.</p>

    <p>As ballast was found in her, she may have been deeper than we have
      described her, or heavily sparred, for it is not customary to put
      ballast in a vessel with a heavy cargo unless she is very crank.
      We mean such a cargo as she probably carried from England. The rig
      common to vessels of her size at the time she was built consisted
      of a single mast with a lateen yard and triangular sail. There is a
      hole in her keelson for the step of the mast.</p>

    <p>No doubt her deck was flush, for trunks and houses are of modern
      invention, and that all her accommodations, and even her galley,
      were below. It is probable that she had a small permanent cabin
      aft, with a companion and binnacle; but we suppose, that, after
      the cargo was stowed, a small platform deck was laid over it for
      the crew. The hemp cables would be stowed forward below, with such
      spare cordage and sails as might be required for a passage across
      the Atlantic Ocean. The quarters for the crew, and the galley,
      would be abaft these, and the entrance to them through the main
      hatchway.</p>

    <p>We notice by grooves in her floor timbers that she had limber-ropes
      for the purpose of keeping a clean channel for <span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>the water to flow
      toward the well. She unquestionably carried a small boat on deck,
      and this, with the anchors, we suppose, were her only incumbrances.
      Such we conceive to be a fair sketch of her, when she was complete.
      We will now give a sketch of her as she is.</p>

    <p>Her keel is of English elm, twenty-eight feet six inches long,
      sided eight inches and moulded six; the floor timbers amidships are
      seven feet one inch long, moulded seven inches and sided six, all
      of oak hewn square at the corners and fastened through the keel
      with one-inch oak treenails wedged in both ends. The first futtocks
      overlap the floor-timbers about two feet, placed alongside of them,
      forming almost solid work on the turn of the bilge, with a glut
      or chock below each of them, but they were not fastened together.
      She has not any navel timbers. We suppose that the joints of the
      second futtocks overlapped in the same style as those below them.
      As already stated, her stem and forefoot are gone; but a part of
      her sternpost, and her stern-knee entire, are left. The sternpost
      is mortised into the keel, and has been bolted through it and
      the knee; but the iron has been oxidized long since. Instead of
      deadwood aft she has seven forked timbers, the longest four feet
      in the stem, with a natural branch on each side, and six inches
      square. Some of these were half fayed to the keel, but none of them
      were fastened. Through these the planking was treenailed. Part of
      the keelson is now in its place; it is sided ten inches and moulded
      eight, and was fastened to the keel with four iron bolts, driven
      between the floor-timbers (not through them) into the keel.</p>

    <p>Her breadth at present, at four feet two inches depth, from the
      outside of the timbers, is eleven feet six inches, but when
      planked, as already stated, it was no doubt twelve feet. She
      had only three strakes of ceiling, all the rest of the timbers
      were bare; but she had no doubt a stout clamp for her deck-beams
      to rest upon and partner-beams as a support to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>her mast. Her
      planking was two inches thick, of English oak, fastened with oak
      treenails. Most of the planks are ten inches wide. The keel has
      been cut to receive the lower edges of the garboards, which had
      been spiked to it as well as treenailed through the timbers. The
      starboard garboard strake is now in its place; and this is the
      only planking we have put on, for the other strakes are somewhat
      warped. Her outline, however, is perhaps more clearly defined than
      if she had been planked throughout. It seems to us that after her
      floor-timbers were laid and planked over, that the other timbers
      were filled in piece by piece as the planking progressed, which
      is still a favorite mode of building in some ports of England,
      and were not jointed together and raised entire before planking.
      By the appearance of the planks they have been scorched on the
      inside and then suddenly saturated in water for the purpose of
      bending them into shape, as a substitute for the modern mode of
      steaming. The planks and treenails which have not been used by us
      are preserved with care, and may be seen by those who wish a more
      minute description of her construction. We suppose she had a heavy
      planksheer or covering-board, and that her deck, like her planking,
      was of English oak. We consider her model superior to that of many
      vessels of the same size and even larger, which have been recently
      built in Nova Scotia, and which may be seen in this port every
      summer.</p>

  <p>With a desire to furnish ship-builders, and others interested in naval
    construction, a plan of the ship, <span class="smcap">D. J. Lawlor</span>, Esq., naval
    architect, has constructed a model of the hull, including the upper
    works, as they must have originally existed. Mr. Lawlor’s scientific<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
    attainments, of which the Government has availed itself in the
    construction of some of the finest ships in our navy, have enabled
    him to reproduce in a model the original lines of the hull,—showing
    perfectly the position and shape of those portions which were worn away
    before its complete burial in the sand. A draught from this model is on
    the second page of this work.</p>

  <p>A written statement accompanies Mr. Lawlor’s model, and his views, it
    will be seen, coincide with those of Messrs. Dolliver and Sleeper.</p>

  <p>The statement of Mr. Lawlor is as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <div class="right smcap">Chelsea, Aug. 22, 1865.</div>
    <div class="smcap">C. W. Livermore, Esq.:</div>

    <p><i>Dear Sir</i>,—I have examined the Pilgrim ship, and find her
      quite a curiosity in naval architecture, so different are her model
      and proportions from those of sea-going vessels of the present
      day. So much of her hull remains entire, that I did not find it a
      difficult task to produce the lines, and complete a perfect working
      model, which I send you herewith. I might furnish you with an
      exact list of measurements, tonnage, &amp;c., and point out the more
      remarkable peculiarities of her construction; but those who may
      have an opportunity to see the ship will obtain a far better idea
      of the ancient style of building than I could hope to give by any
      verbal description, however minute. She must have been an easy
      sea-boat, and, for that early day, well adapted to the carrying of
      passengers. The pleasure of observing and studying so ancient and
      unique a specimen of ship-building has more than repaid the time
      and attention I have been able to bestow upon it.</p>

      <div style="text-align: right; margin-right: 6.5em;">Yours, resp’ly,</div>

    <p>An inquiry naturally suggests itself, By what means has a wreck, so
      perfect that a “working model” could be constructed from it, been so
      long preserved? Ordinarily, wrecks, being exposed to the direct action
      of the winds and waves, soon break up and disappear. How does it happen
      that this wreck formed an exception? That it was preserved by being
      embedded and buried in the sand, has been already intimated. The causes
      which at first operated to bury and conceal, and, at length, by their
      continued action brought the wreck to light, will be considered in the
      following chapter.</p>

    SHORE composed of the geological formation known as “drift,” and
    directly exposed to the action of the sea, is doomed to undergo many
    and rapid changes. By comparing the map, inserted on the next page, of
    Cape Cod as it was at the time of its discovery, with the modern map,
    the great changes made on the eastern coast by winds, waves and tides
    will be at once made apparent.</p>

  <p>In regard to the geological changes, we present here a short extract
    from the recently published and highly entertaining work of Thoreau:</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>
  <blockquote>

    <p>“Between October, 1849, and June of the next year, I found
      that the bank [in Truro] had lost about forty feet in one place,
      opposite the lighthouse, and it was cracked more than forty feet
      from the edge at the last date, the shore being strewn with the
      recent rubbish. But I judged that generally it is not wearing away
      here at the rate of more than six feet annually.... The general
      statement of the inhabitants is, that the Cape is wasting on both
      sides, but extending itself on particular points on the south and
      west, as at Chatham and Monomoy Beaches, and at Billingsgate, Long
      and Race Points. James Freeman stated in his day that above three
      miles had been added to Monomoy Beach during the previous fifty
      years, and it is said to be still extending as fast as ever. A
      writer in the Massachusetts Magazine, in the last century, tells
      us that ‘when the English first settled upon the Cape, there was
      an island off Chatham, at three leagues’ distance, called Webbs’
      Island, containing twenty acres covered with red cedar or savin.
      The inhabitants of Nantucket used to carry wood from it;’ but he
      adds that in his day a large rock alone marked the spot, and the
      water was six fathoms deep there. The entrance to Nauset harbor,
      which was once in Eastham, has now travelled south into Orleans....</p>

    <p>“On the eastern side the sea appears to be everywhere encroaching
      on the land.... The bars along the coast shift with every storm.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In the hurricane of April, 1851, in which Minot’s Ledge lighthouse was
    swept away, many and great changes took place on the eastern side of
    the Cape. A deep and spacious entrance was made into Chatham harbor,
    which still continues to be very advantageous to the towns of Harwich
    and Orleans; but the subsequent extension of bars, from an island lying
    in the direction of Chatham, now prevents the business portion of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
    place from deriving that benefit from the new opening which they at
    first received.</p>

  <p>Thoreau thus speaks of what fell under his own observation, during his
    last visit to Cape Cod:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“We ourselves observed the effect of a single storm with a high
      tide in the night, in July, 1855. It moved the sand on the beach
      opposite [Highland] lighthouse to the depth of six feet, and three
      rods in width as far as we could see north and south, and carried
      it bodily off, no one knows exactly where, laying bare in one place
      a rock five feet high, which was invisible before, and narrowing
      the beach to that extent. There is usually, as I have said, no
      bathing on the back side of the Cape, on account of the undertow,
      but when we were there last the sea had three months before cast
      up a bar near this lighthouse, two miles long and ten rods wide,
      leaving a narrow cove, then a quarter of a mile long, between it
      and the shore, which afforded excellent bathing. This cove had
      from time to time been closed up as the bar travelled northward,
      in one instance imprisoning four or five hundred whiting and cod,
      which died there, and the water as often turned fresh, and finally
      gave place to sand. This bar, the inhabitants assured us, might be
      wholly removed, and the water six feet deep there in two or three
      days.”—p. 142.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Along the eastern shores of Eastham and Orleans, the strong current
    of the ebb and of a portion of the flood tide sets in a southerly
    direction,—the undertow breaking up and carrying with it the sands
    from the bottom. On reaching the mouth of the Potanumaquut harbor the
    current, setting in, deposits this sand, thus prolonging the northern
    point of the entrance-way; but, acting more directly on the southern
    point, and aided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span> by the retreating sea at ebb tide, the moving mass
    of water must necessarily cut away the southerly bank,—so that the
    northern point continually increasing in length and the southern point
    shortening, or losing material, the harbor entrance is continually
    travelling southward.</p>

  <p>When the Sparrow-Hawk grounded for the last time within the northern
    point, under the influence of a westerly gale, the sand must have
    rapidly accumulated about her, in the manner and from the causes we
    have just described. Still there would be, for a considerable time,
    shallow waters about her after the sand had filled in the bay nearly
    to her deck; and the ends of her timbers which were uppermost show at
    this date the rounded form which we should expect to find from a flow
    of waves and the attrition of the sands. But the wind is also busy on
    the bleak shore of the Cape; the sand is blown inward from the top of
    the sea line of cliffs; and in a few years from her first becoming
    embedded, she must have been completely submerged. Above and around
    her, at length the salt-marsh extended itself; but the place was well
    known, and the name of “Old Ship Harbor” then obtained,—nor was this
    name forgotten, although all knowledge of the ship itself had faded
    from the memory of men.</p>

  <p>In further illustration of our subject, we insert an extract from the
    Massachusetts Historical Collections, vol. viii. p. 143. Boston: Munroe
    &amp; Francis, 1802:&#x2060;—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Few towns in the county are so well provided with harbors as
      Chatham. The first and most important, is on the eastern side of
      the town, and is called Old harbour. It is formed by a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>narrow
      beach, which completely guards it against the ocean. The haven on
      the western side of this beach is extensive; but the harbour of
      Chatham is supposed to reach not farther north than Strong island,
      a distance of about four miles. Above that, the water, which is
      within the limits of Harwich and Orleans, is known by other names.
      The breadth of the harbour, is about three-quarters of a mile. Its
      entrance, a quarter of a mile wide, is formed by a point of the
      beach and James’ head, east of it on the main land. On the inside
      of the beach are flats and salt marsh. There is also a piece of
      marsh on the southern part of Strong island. These marshes are
      covered during every tide.</p>

    <p>“There are no rocks either within or near the harbour; but its
      mouth is obstructed by bars, which extend east and southeast of
      the point of the beach three quarters of a mile. On each side of
      this mouth is a breaker,—one called the North, and the other the
      South breaker. There are also several bars in the harbour within
      the outer bars. These bars are continually shifting,—the causes
      of which are storms and a strong current which sets in and out
      of the harbour. At low water, there are seven feet on the outer
      bars, common tides rising about six feet. North of them, the shore
      is bolder. There is good holding ground in the harbour. At the
      entrance, the bottom is sandy. Farther in there is a muddy bottom.
      The depth at low water is about twenty feet.</p>

    <p>“Not only do the bars alter, but the mouth of the harbour also is
      perpetually varying. At present it is gradually moving southward
      by the addition of sand to the point of the beach. The beach has
      thus been extended above a mile within the course of the past forty
      years.</p>

    <p>“In the year 1626, there was an entrance into Monamoyick harbour,
      opposite Potanumaquut, six miles north of the present mouth. The
      ship mentioned by Prince<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> came in here, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>was stranded on the
      beach, where its ruins were to be seen about twenty years ago.
      This part of the beach still bears the name of the Old Ship. The
      entrance has been closed for many years. Several passages into
      the harbour have been opened and shut since that time. At a late
      period, there were two openings into the haven,—one of which, that
      which now exists, was styled the Old harbour, and the other, the
      New harbour.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Though the mouth of the New harbour is entirely
      choked up with sand, yet the name, Old harbour, is still retained.</p>

    <p>“It is not easy to give directions for sailing into so inconstant
      a port. None but a pilot who is well acquainted with its yearly
      variations can guide in a vessel with safety. On a signal being
      made, however, boats are ready to put off from the shore, to yield
      assistance. In a north-east storm, in which a pilot cannot leave
      the land, a vessel, by getting to the south of the South breaker,
      may, at present, ride with safety. But how long this will be true,
      it is impossible to say.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The following account of a tremendous storm and its effects, is from
    the able work of the Rev. <span class="smcap">Frederick Freeman</span>,—“History of Cape
    Cod; Annals of Barnstable County and of its several towns”:&#x2060;—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Among the remarkable events of this early period is recorded that
      of a violent storm which did great damage, the tide rising twenty
      feet perpendicular.” Hubbard and Morton say: “The Narragansets were
      obliged to betake themselves to the tops of trees, and yet many of
      them were drowned. Many hundred thousand of trees were blown down,
      turning up the stronger by the roots, and breaking the high pines
      and such like in the midst. Tall young oaks and walnut trees of
      good bigness were wound as a withe by it.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

    <p>“Governor Bradford’s account of the storm is as follows: ‘In 1635,
      August 15, was such a mighty storm of wind and rain as none living
      in these parts, either English or Indians, ever saw. It began in
      the morning a little before day, and came with great violence,
      causing the sea to swell above twenty feet right up, and made many
      inhabitants climb into the trees.... It began southeast, and parted
      toward the south and east, and veered sundry ways. The wrecks of it
      will remain a hundred years. The moon suffered a great eclipse the
      second night after it.</p>

    <p>“It was in this storm that Mr. Thacher was cast ashore at Cape Ann,
      on what was afterward known as Thacher’s Island. Twenty-one persons
      were drowned. None were saved but Mr. Anthony Thacher and wife.”</p>

    now proceed to give the history of the ancient ship according to the
    chronological order of events. The reader’s attention is invited to the
    following interesting and important extract from “Bradford’s History of
    Plymouth Plantations, A. D. 1626–7,” MS. p. 146:&#x2060;—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Ther is one thing that fell out in y<sup>e</sup> begining of y<sup>e</sup> winter
      before, which I have refferred to this place, that I may handle
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>y<sup>e</sup> whole matter togeither. Ther was a ship, with many passengers
      in her and sundrie goods, bound for Virginia. They had lost them
      selves at sea, either by y<sup>e</sup> insufficiencie of y<sup>e</sup> maister, or his
      ilnes; for he was sick &amp; lame of y<sup>e</sup> scurvie, so that he could
      but lye in y<sup>e</sup> cabin dore &amp; give direction; and it should seeme
      was badly assisted either w<sup>th</sup> mate or mariners; or else y<sup>e</sup>
      fear and unrulines of y<sup>e</sup> passengers were such, as they made them
      stear a course betweene y<sup>e</sup> southwest &amp; y<sup>e</sup> norwest, that they
      might fall with some land, what soever it was they cared not. For
      they had been 6. weeks at sea, and had no water, nor beere, nor
      any woode left, but had burnt up all their emptie caske; only
      one of y<sup>e</sup> company had a hogshead of wine or 2. which was allso
      allmost spente, so as they feared they should be starved at sea, or
      consumed with diseases, which made them rune this desperate course.
      But it plased God that though they came so neare y<sup>e</sup> shoulds of
      Cap-Codd [147] or else ran stumbling over them in y<sup>e</sup> night,
      they knew not how, they came right before a small blind harbore
      that lyes aboute y<sup>e</sup> midle of Manamoyake Bay to y<sup>e</sup> Southward of
      Cap-Codd, with a small gale of wind; and about highwater toucht
      upon a barr of sand that lyes before it, but had no hurte, y<sup>e</sup> sea
      being smoth; so they laid out an anchore. But towards the evēing,
      the winde sprunge up at sea, and was so rough, as broake their
      cable, &amp; beat them over the barr into y<sup>e</sup> harbor, wher they saved
      their lives &amp; goods, though much were hurte with salt water; for
      w<sup>th</sup> beating they had sprung y<sup>e</sup> but end of a planke or too,
      &amp; beat out their occome; but they were soone over, and ran on a
      drie slate within the harbor, close by a beach; so at low water
      they gatt out their goods on drie shore, and dried those that were
      wette, and saved most of their things without any great loss;
      neither was y<sup>e</sup> ship much hurt, but shee might be mended, and made
      servisable againe. But though they were not a litle glad that they
      had thus saved their lives, yet when they had a litle refreshed
      them selves, and begane to thinke on their condition, not knowing
      wher they were, nor what they should doe, they begane <span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>to be
      strucken with sadnes. But shortly after they saw some Indians come
      to them in canows, which made them stand upon their gard. But when
      they heard some of y<sup>e</sup> Indeans speake English unto them, they were
      not a litle revived, especially when they heard them demand if they
      were the Gove<sup>r</sup> of Plimoths men, or freinds; and y<sup>t</sup> they would
      bring them to y<sup>e</sup> English houses, or carry their letters.</p>

    <p>“They feasted these Indeans, and gave them many giftes; and sente
      2. men and a letter with them to y<sup>e</sup> Gove<sup>r</sup>, and did intreat him
      to send a boat unto them, with some pitch, &amp; occume, and spiks,
      w<sup>th</sup> divers other necessaries for y<sup>e</sup> mending of ther ship (which
      was recoverable). Allso they besought him to help them with some
      corne and sundrie other things they wanted, to enable them to make
      their viage to Virginia; and they should be much bound to him, and
      would make satisfaction for any thing they had, in any comodities
      they had abord. After y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> was well informed by y<sup>e</sup> messengers
      of their condition, he caused a boate to be made ready, and such
      things to be provided as they write for; and because others were
      abroad upon trading, and such other affairs, as had been fitte to
      send unto them, he went him selfe, &amp; allso carried some trading
      comodities, to buy them corne of y<sup>e</sup> Indeans. “It was no season
      of y<sup>e</sup> year to goe withoute y<sup>e</sup> Cape, but understanding wher y<sup>e</sup>
      ship lay, he went into y<sup>e</sup> bottom of y<sup>e</sup> bay, on y<sup>e</sup> inside, and
      put into a crick called Naumskachett,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> wher it is not much above
      2. mile over [148] land to y<sup>e</sup> bay wher they were, wher he had
      y<sup>e</sup> Indeans ready to cary over any thing to them. Of his arrivall
      they were very glad, and received the things to mend ther ship,
      &amp; other necessaries. Allso he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span> bought them as much corne as they
      would have; and wheras some of their sea-men were rune away among
      y<sup>e</sup> Indeans, he procured their returne to y<sup>e</sup> ship, and so left
      them well furnished and contented, being very thankfull for y<sup>e</sup>
      curtesies they receaved. But after the Gove<sup>r</sup> thus left them, he
      went into some other harbors ther aboute, and loaded his boate with
      corne, which he traded, and so went home. But he had not been at
      home many days, but he had notice from them, that by the violence
      of a great storme, and y<sup>e</sup> bad morring of their ship (after she
      was mended) she was put a shore, and so beatten and shaken as she
      was now wholy unfitte to goe to sea.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> And so their request was
      that they might have leave to repaire to them, and soujourne with
      them, till they could have means to convey them selves to Virginia;
      and that they might have means to trāsport their goods, and they
      would pay for y<sup>e</sup> fame, or any thing els wher with y<sup>e</sup> plantation
      should releeve them. Considering their distres, their requests
      were granted, and all helpfullnes done unto them; their goods
      transported, and them selves &amp; goods sheltered in their houses as
      well as they could.</p>

    <p>“The cheefe amongst these people was one M<sup>r</sup>. Fells and M<sup>r</sup>. Sibsie
      which had many servants belonging unto them, many of them being
      Irish. Some others ther were y<sup>t</sup> had a servante or 2. a peece; but
      y<sup>e</sup> most were servants, and such as were ingaged to the former
      persons, who allso had y<sup>e</sup> most goods. Affter they were hither
      come, and some thing setled, the maisters desired some ground to
      imploye ther servants upon; seing it was like to be y<sup>e</sup> latter
      end of y<sup>e</sup> year before they could have passage for Virginia, and
      they had now y<sup>e</sup> winter before them; they might clear some ground
      and plant a crope, (seeing they had tools &amp; necessaries for y<sup>e</sup>
      same) to help to bear their charge, and keep their <span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>servants in
      imployment; and if they had oppertunitie to departe before the same
      was ripe, they would sell it on y<sup>e</sup> ground. So they had ground
      appointed them in convenient places, and Fells &amp; some other of them
      raised a great deall of corne, which they sould at their departure.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The historian here details some domestic infelicities of Mr. Fells in
    consequence of which the Plymouth Pilgrims</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">“pact him away &amp; those that belonged unto him by the first
      oppertunitie, and dismiste all the rest as soone as could, being
      many untoward people amongst them; though ther were allso some
      that caried them selves very orderly all y<sup>e</sup> time they stayed. And
      the plantation [149] had some benefite by them, in selling them
      corne &amp; other provisions of food for cloathing; for they had of
      diverse kinds, as cloath, perpetuanes, &amp; other stuffs, besids hose,
      &amp; shoes, and such like comodities as y<sup>e</sup> planters stood in need
      of. So they both did good, and received good one from another; and

  <p>To the account of the loss of the ship, Freeman’s “History of Cape Cod;
    Annals,” &amp;c., appends the following note:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The beach where this ship was wrecked was thenceforward called
      “The Old Ship.” The remains of the wreck were visible many years.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The January number of the N. E. Historical and Genealogical Register
    for 1864 (p. 37) contains an able article by <span class="smcap">Amos Otis</span>,
    Esq., in which allusion is made to the tradition that the name of the
    old ship was “Sparrow-Hawk.” Mr. Otis speaks of this tradition as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
    uncertain. We will give the tradition as it is, and leave it to make
    its own impression on our readers. A family by the name of Sparrow has
    long resided in the close vicinity of the Old Ship Harbor. The first
    settler of the name, Mr. Jonathan Sparrow, bought the land, where the
    family now live, in 1675. The present proprietor, Mr. James L. Sparrow,
    states that it had been “handed down” from father to son that there was
    an old ship buried in the sand in Potanumaquut Harbor in the early days
    of the colony, and that its name was “Sparahawk,” or “Sparrow-Hawk.”</p>

  <p>Mr. Otis remarks, that “the evidence which seems to prove beyond a
    reasonable doubt that those remains belong to the ship which Gov.
    Bradford informs us was lost in Potanumaquut harbor in the winter
    of 1626–7 ... is principally based on the geological changes that
    have occurred on the coast, since its discovery. Archer’s account of
    Gosnold’s voyage around the Cape, in 1602, and of the appearance of
    the coast, is so unlike anything seen by the modern mariner, that his
    relation has been considered a myth or traveller’s tale, unreliable and
    unworthy of credence. Geological inquiries may seem out of place in a
    historical and genealogical journal; but if they do nothing more, they
    will verify the accuracy of Archer’s descriptions, and thus aid us in
    our investigations of the truths of history.</p>

  <p>“The accounts of the wrecked ship in Morton and Prince, are copied
    from Bradford. Morton is not careful in his dates, but he informs us
    that the master was a Scotchman, named Johnston, a fact not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span> stated
    by Bradford. Mr. Prince with his accustomed accuracy, states that a
    ship was lost in the beginning of the winter [December], 1626. Gov.
    Bradford’s description of the place where the ship was lost, would be
    perfectly clear and distinct if the configuration of the coast was the
    same now as it was when he wrote. Namaskachet Creek remains, but Isle
    Nauset, Points Care and Gilbert, have been swept away by the waves and
    currents of the ocean. Where Monamoick Bay was, there is a straight
    line of sea-coast; where an open sea then was, now long beaches meet
    the eye; and where were navigable waters, now we see sandy wastes and
    salt meadows.</p>

  <p>“Such remarkable changes having been made in the configuration of this
    coast since its discovery by Gosnold, and its examination by Smith, in
    1614, is it surprising that the knowledge of the location of “Old Ship
    Harbor” should have been lost, or that the readers of Bradford should
    have been unable to determine where Monamoick Bay was?</p>

  <p>“Prof. Agassiz, of Cambridge, in company with the writer and others,
    has recently made a careful geological examination of the eastern coast
    of the towns of Eastham, Orleans, and Chatham.... The result was a
    verification of the accuracy of Archer’s description of the coast.</p>

  <p>“This examination enables me to draw an outline map of the coast as it
    was in 1602, and in 1626. I have also a map of the harbors, beaches,
    and salt meadows as they were, and as they now are.” [V. map, p. 14.]</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>In Gov. Bradford’s account, which we have already quoted, he says
      that “he landed on Naumskachett creek” on the inside of the bay.
      From the fact that the distance from this creek, which now forms
      a part of the boundary line between Brewster and Orleans, to the
      navigable waters of Potanumaquut is about two miles,—as stated by
      Bradford,—while to Nauset harbor, the distance is greater, Mr. Otis
      considers it proved “beyond controversy that Potanumaquut was the
      harbor into which the ship ‘stumbled.’”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We quote from Mr. Otis, the facts in relation to the discovery:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“On the 6th of May, 1863, Messrs. Solomon Linnell, 2d, and Alfred
      Rogers, of Orleans, were on Nauset Beach, and discovered portions
      of a wreck. Mr. Linnell was at the same place on the 4th, when no
      part of the wreck was visible. This proves that it was uncovered
      between the 4th and 6th of May, 1863. When first discovered, it was
      partially covered with the marsh mud in which the wreck had been
      embedded. On removing some of the mud, they found a quantity of
      charcoal, and the appearance of the timbers and planks indicated
      that the vessel of which these were the remains had been burnt.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
      On Saturday, May 9, Leander Crosby, Esq., visited the wreck, and
      collected a quantity of beef and mutton bones; several soles of
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>shoes, probably made for sandals; a smoking pipe of the kind used
      by smokers of opium; and a metallic box.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Dr. Benj. F. Seabury and John Doane, Jr., afterwards visited the wreck,
    and found the rudder lying a few feet distant; this they removed, and
    it is now deposited in the hall of the Pilgrim society, at Plymouth.
    Messrs. Seabury and Doane took measurements of the ship, and public
    attention was now drawn to a consideration of the subject.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The peculiar model of the wreck excited the curiosity of the
      people, and although four miles from the village, it was visited
      by hundreds, and each one took a fragment as a memento of his
      visit. At the time the writer was there the current had swept out
      a basin in the sand around the wreck, and it being low tide, every
      part excepting the keel could be examined. One striking part was
      immediately noticed by everyone,—the long, tail-like projection
      at the stern. The oldest sailor never saw a vessel built on
      that model, she must have had, to use a nautical expression, “a
      clean run,” and have been a good sea-boat.... She had been most
      carefully built. The frames were placed side by side.... There
      were twenty-three regular frames remaining, or forty-six timbers,
      not counting the six at the stern. At the bow several frames were
      missing. The planks were fastened with spikes and treenails, in the
      same manner as at the present time. Some of the treenails had been
      wedged after they were first driven, showing that some repairs had
      been made.</p>

    <p>“The timbers and planks of the old ship are very <span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>sound, there
      is no appearance of rot. There are no barnacles upon them, they
      are not eaten by worms, and there is no indication that they have
      been for any considerable length of time exposed to the action of
      the elements. The spikes, bolts and other fastenings of iron have
      entirely disappeared, ... rust had gradually consumed them, and
      discolored sand indicated the places where the iron once was. The
      wreck was embedded in marsh mud and covered deeply in sand. Under
      such circumstances air was almost wholly excluded, and oxidation
      must have been slow.</p>

    <p>“Though called a ship, she had only one mast, and that as shown by
      the mortise in the keelson, was nearly midship.”</p>

    <p>“In August last, the wreck was again covered with sand, and is
      now buried several feet below the surface, where it may remain
      undiscovered for ages. Centuries hence some plodding antiquarian
      may labor to prove it to be the same I have described in this
      article.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>

  <p>“One point remains to be considered. Is the wreck recently discovered
    a part of Capt. Johnston’s ship, lost in 1626? The reader will look at
    his map. ‘Ile Nawset’ was of the drift formation, hilly, and in some
    parts rocky. No part of it now remains. About fifty years ago, a small
    portion of it, called Slut’s Bush, had not washed away. The sand on
    its shores, and most of which has been washed by the currents from the
    north, has blown inward by the winds, covering the meadows within, and
    in some places filling the navigable channels and harbors on the west.
    In some places the waves of the ocean have swept across the beach, and
    transported immense quantities of sand to the meadows in a single tide.”</p>

  <p>“The wreck of the Old Ship is on the second lot of the Potanumaquut
    meadows.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This was always known as the Old Ship lot, but why it
    was so called no one could explain. Now the reason is apparent. The
    position of the wreck has not probably changed since it sunk in the
    place where it now lies. At low tide there are about two feet of water
    around it, showing that at high water there was a sufficient depth to
    have floated a vessel of seventy tons burthen. Every portion of the
    wreck is below the surface of the meadows. These <span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>two facts prove that
    this vessel was not cast away upon a beach nor on the meadows.</p>

  <p>“At the present time a wreck sunk in such a situation would be covered
    with sand and mud in the course of a month. Similar causes existed
    then, and it is safe to assume that Capt. Johnston’s vessel was covered
    up very soon after she was lost.</p>

  <p>“Salt meadows do not form on a shore where a surf beats, or where a
    strong current exists. While the ancient entrance to the harbor was
    open, there was such a current on the west or inside of Isle Nauset,
    which prevented the formation of salt meadow near the wreck. After
    the closing of the old entrance, the current turned west of Pochett
    and Sampson’s islands, and found an outlet through Pleasant bay,
    to Chatham harbor, thus leaving a body of still water favorable to
    the rapid formation of salt meadows. This view is confirmed by the
    Eastham records. That town was settled in 1646, and in the early
    division of meadows, the Potanumaquut are not named. As salt meadows
    were considered more valuable then, than at the present time, it is
    surprising that they are not named till 1750, if they had then existed.</p>

  <p>“Records cannot be quoted to prove the antiquity of this wreck, neither
    can it be proved by living witnesses; we necessarily have to rely on
    other testimony. That the rust had entirely consumed all the iron used
    in its construction is evidence of its antiquity. The position of the
    wreck in reference to navigable waters, to the salt meadows, and to the
    beaches is reliable testimony.</p>

  <p>“Now <i>it is perfectly certain</i> that this wreck must have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span> been in
    its present position since the year 1750, or 113 years, for since that
    date there have been no navigable waters within a quarter of a mile of
    the spot where it lies. <i>It is also certain</i> that it must have
    been in its present position during all that period, prior to 1750,
    while the meadows were forming around it, and on the west. If it is
    admitted that those meadows are of recent formation, one hundred years
    would be a low estimate, making the whole time 213 years.</p>

  <p>“If it be said that the Potanumaquut meadows belong to the older and
    not to the recent formation, it proves too much; it proves that the
    wreck has been in its present position many centuries—that it is
    the remains of an old ship in which the Northmen, or other ancient
    navigators sailed.</p>

  <p>“The position of this wreck in reference to the salt meadows and to the
    beach, is the best possible evidence of its antiquity. If driven there
    it must have been by a westerly wind, which would cause a low tide.
    Admitting that the vessel of which this wreck is the remains, was, by
    some unknown cause, forced on the meadows, how was the wreck buried
    below the line of the surface?</p>

  <p>“To suppose that she was so buried on hard meadows by natural causes
    is an impossibility. That the wreck was there first, and the meadows
    formed over it, seems a self-evident truth, and judging from the rate
    at which similar meadows have formed, two hundred and thirty-seven
    years is not an unreasonable length of time to assign for the formation
    of the Potanumaquut meadows, and consequently the length of time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> that
    the wreck of the Old Ship, at Orleans, has remained in its present
    position.</p>

  <p>“Those who are not aware of the remarkable geological changes that have
    occurred on the eastern coast of Cape Cod since its discovery, doubt
    the truthfulness of Archer, who was the historian of Gosnold’s voyages.
    I have in this article assumed that he was a careful and an accurate
    observer, and faithfully recorded what he saw. Great geological changes
    make their own records; they leave in the strata and in the various
    deposits, the footprints which the scientific student of nature can
    trace and follow.</p>

  <p>“Cape Cod was discovered by Bartholomew Gosnold, May 15th, 1602, O.
    S. He anchored at first near the end of the Cape, which he called
    Shoal Hope, but afterwards changed to the name it has since retained.
    Afterwards he anchored in the harbor, in latitude 42°. On the 16th
    he sailed round the Cape. After proceeding twelve leagues in this
    circuitous course, he descried a point of land ‘a good distance off’
    with shoals near it. He ‘kept his luff’ to double it, and after passing
    it ‘bore up again with the land’ and at night anchored, where he
    remained that night and the following day, May 17.</p>

  <p>“He saw many shoals in that vicinity, and ‘another point that lay in
    his course.’ On the 18th he sent a boat to sound around the point, and
    on the 19th passed around it in four or five fathoms and anchored a
    league or somewhat more beyond it, in latitude 41° 40′.</p>

  <p>“Nothing is named in this account that the most careless observer would
    not have seen and noted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span> When he discovered the first point he was
    off Eastham, a little north of the beach where the ‘Three Lights’ are
    now located. He saw the danger, and like a prudent mariner kept his
    luff to avoid it. The shoal he called Tucker’s Terror, the headland,
    Point Care. After passing Point Care he bore up again to the mainland.
    This description of the coast is simple and truthful. To determine the
    exact position of Point Care, is attended with some difficulty. That it
    was the north end headland of the island named by Capt John Smith ‘Ile
    Nawset,’ there appears to be no reason to doubt. The only difficulty
    is in determining precisely where the north end of that island was
    in 1602. The northern end of it, which persons living remember, was
    opposite the present entrance to Nauset Harbor. In 1602 it probably
    extended half a mile further north, that is, as far north as the low
    beach extended, that persons now living remember. John Doane, Esq., now
    seventy years of age, was born in the immediate vicinity of Point Care,
    his father and grandfather, in fact all his ancestors from the first
    settlement, owned the land and meadows between Ile Nawset and the main.
    He says that within his recollection Point Care has worn away about
    half a mile. When his grandfather was a boy, Point Care extended much
    further into the ocean than it did when he was young.”</p>

  <p>These are not vague and uncertain recollections. Mr. Doane points to
    monuments, and the exact distance that the ocean encroached on the
    land within his recollection can be ascertained. He states that fifty
    years ago a beach extended from the present entrance of Nauset<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span> harbor
    half a mile north, where the entrance then was. Within this beach his
    father owned ten acres of salt meadows, on which he for several years
    assisted him in cutting and raking the hay. Now where that beach was
    there are three or four fathoms of water, and where the meadows were is
    a sand bar on which the waves continually break, and make Nauset harbor
    difficult of access. Within his memory the north beach, connected
    with Eastham shore, has extended south one mile, and the whole beach
    has moved inward about its width, say one fourth of a mile. Formerly
    there were navigable waters between Nauset and Potanumaquut harbors.
    It is about a century since vessels have passed through, and about
    fifty years since the passage was entirely closed. This is caused by
    the moving of Nauset beach inward. Dunes always travel inward, never
    outward, let the direction be what it may.</p>

  <p>“Mr. Doane says that his grandfather informed him, that when he was
    young, a rocky, swampy piece of land, known as Slut’s Bush, was about
    in the middle of Isle Nauset; that many berries grew there, and that
    he had repeatedly been there to pick them. When the present John Doane
    was a lad, only the western edge of this swamp remained. The roots of
    the trees and bushes that grew there ran under and between the rocks
    and stones, and when the waves undermined the rocks, the whole, rocks,
    stumps and roots, settled together. Slut’s Bush is now some distance
    from the shore, in deep water; vessels pass over it, and on a calm day
    the stumps and roots may be seen at the bottom. The fisherman sometimes
    gets his line entangled with them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span> and pulls them up. During violent
    gales of wind they are sometimes loosened and driven to the shore.</p>

  <p>“Beyond Slut’s Bush, about three miles from the shore, there is a
    similar ledge called Beriah’s Ledge, probably formed in precisely
    the same manner as Slut’s Bush ledge is known to have been formed.
    Six nautical miles south of Point Care, Gosnold discovered another
    headland, which he named Point Gilbert. Archer furnishes us with all
    the particulars respecting the soundings, the straits, his passing
    round it, and anchoring a league or more beyond, in latitude 41° 40′.
    We have historical and circumstantial evidence that Point Gilbert
    existed in 1602; it united with the main land at James Head, near
    Chatham lights. From James Head on its south shore, it extended nine
    miles on an east-by-south course, to its eastern terminus, afterwards
    known as Webb’s Island, situate where Crabb’s Ledge now is. Cape Care
    was worn away by the gradual abrasion of the waves; over Point Gilbert
    the sea, during a violent gale, swept, carrying away long sections in
    a single day. The inner ledge on the line of Point Gilbert is known as
    Island Ledge, and the name indicates that the sea broke over the point
    at two places about the same time. Rev. Dr. Morse states that Webb’s
    island at one time contained fifteen acres of rocky land covered with
    wood from which the early inhabitants of Nantucket procured fuel.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
    The process which has been described as having occurred at Slut’s Bush
    ledge also occurred at Crabb and Island ledges; the stumps and roots of
    the trees were carried down by <span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>the superincumbent rocks. Mr. Joshua
    Y. Bearse, who resided many years at Monamoit point, and has all his
    life been familiar with the shoals and ledges near Chatham, informs
    me that it is very difficult to obtain an anchor lost near either of
    these ledges; the sweeps used catch against the rocks and stumps at the
    bottom where the water is four fathoms deep. He also states that after
    the violent gale in 1851, during which the sea broke over Nauset Beach
    where the ancient entrance to Potanumaquut harbor was, and where the
    entrance to Chatham harbor was in 1775, with a force which seems almost
    incredible, sweeping away banks of earth twenty feet high, cutting
    channels therein five fathoms deep, moving the sea around to its very
    bottom, and tearing up the old stumps which had been there more than a
    century,—Mr. Bearse states that more than one hundred of these drifted
    during that gale to the shore at Monamoit beach, and that he picked
    them up for fuel. A part of these were stumps that bore the marks of
    the axe, but the greater part were broken or rotted off.</p>

  <p>“These old stumps did not grow under the water; they did not float to
    the positions from which they were dragged up; they grew in a compact
    rocky soil overlying a loose sand. The waves and the currents removed
    the loose substratum, and the rocks and the stumps went down together
    into the deep water where they are now found. From the place where
    Gosnold anchored, a league or more from Point Gilbert, there was an
    open sea to the southwest. Monamoit beach, which projects out eight
    miles south from Morris island, did not then exist; there was nothing
    there to impede navigation.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

  <p>[“Prof. Agassiz who is the author of the geological theory which the
    accompanying map delineates, furnishes us with the following note,
    dated Cambridge, December 17, 1863.</p>

  <p>“Surprising and perhaps incredible as the statements of Mr. Amos Otis
    may appear, they are nevertheless the direct and natural inference
    of observations which may easily be made along the eastern coast of
    Cape Cod. Having of late felt a special interest in the geological
    structure of that remarkable region, I have repeatedly visited it
    during the last summer, and in company with Mr. Otis examined on
    one occasion with the most minute care, the evidence of the former
    existence of Isle Nauset and Point Gilbert. I found it as satisfactory
    as any geological evidence can be. Besides its scientific interest,
    this result has some historical importance. At all events it fully
    vindicates Archer’s account of the aspect of Cape Cod, at the time
    of its discovery in 1602, and shows him to have been a truthful and
    accurate observer.—Editor.”]</p>

  <p>It only remains to state the facts in regard to the final recovery
    and saving of the wreck. Messrs. Leander Crosby and John Doane, Jr.,
    assisted by Solomon Linnell, 2d, Alfred Rogers, and others, conveyed
    the planks and timbers, at various times, to the upland. One mass,
    including the keel and thirteen timbers, was thrown out by the sea, and
    was at once secured. The whole was collected together, on the premises
    of Mr. Crosby, whence it was conveyed to Boston, and the pieces
    restored to their original position, as already related, by Messrs.
    Dolliver and Sleeper.</p>

  <p class="mt3">The publishers of this pamphlet have, in a few instances in the course
    of the work, made use of the traditional name, “Sparrow-Hawk.” Perhaps
    nice historical accuracy would object to this; but our readers, we
    doubt not, will excuse us, on the ground that in speaking of a person
    or a ship it is very convenient to make use of some proper name: and
    we have, therefore, used the appellation which finds its basis in a
    tradition of the vicinity where the wreck was found. (<i>V.</i> p. 25.)</p>

  <p>The house of Miles Standish at Captain’s Hill, in Duxbury, was
    destroyed by fire about the year 1665. In 1856, James Hall, Esq.,
    the proprietor of the Miles Standish estate, caused the rubbish to
    be removed from the cellar; here he found several pipes, once no
    doubt the property of the redoubtable Captain. Two of these have been
    kindly loaned by Mr. Hall to the proprietors of the ancient wreck; and
    on comparing them with the pipes found in the wreck, they are seen
    to be almost exactly alike, even to a series of small indentations
    surrounding the top of the bowl. This curious similarity serves to
    indicate the age of the ship, and were there no other clew, would
    assure us that her date is to be assigned to the time of the Pilgrims.</p>

  <p>To remove from the public mind any distrust as to the genuineness of
    the relic whose history is related in the preceding pages, we insert
    below testimony from various sources, including letters from gentlemen
    whose names are widely known and honored.</p>

    <p><i>Gentlemen</i>,—It is not surprising that a portion of the public
      look with suspicion upon the statement that you have in your
      possession the wreck of a vessel which was stranded on Cape Cod
      some two hundred and forty years ago. To assist you in removing
      such suspicion, which we regard as unfounded, permit us to say,
      that after a careful examination of the wreck itself; after
      investigating the circumstances of its position and condition when
      found, and the traditions concerning it; after collating with
      these the several accounts contained in the Histories of Governor
      Bradford, Secretary Morton, and Prince, the annalist,—we have been
      led irresistibly to the conclusion that the “Old Ship” has the
      antiquity which you claim for it, and are of opinion that it is the
      identical wreck visited by Governor Bradford in 1626,—as narrated
      by him in his history of Plymouth Plantation, page 217. The wreck
      we regard as a remarkable curiosity, and well worthy a visit by all
      who are in any degree interested in our early colonial history.</p>

  <p>The following letter is from a native of Orleans,—one familiar with
    its localities,—the well-known President of the National Bank of the
    Republic:</p>

    <div class="right"><span class="smcap">Boston</span>, Oct. 10, 1865.</div>

    <div><span class="smcap">Messrs. Crosby</span> &amp; <span class="smcap">Livermore:</span></div>

    <p><i>Gentlemen</i>,—Familiar as I am with Cape names and Cape men,
      I have, from the first, felt assured that the wreck exhibited by
      you on the Common was what it purports to be; for the testimony
      of well-known citizens of Cape Cod came simultaneously with
      the discovery which they made. Amos Otis, Esq., Cashier of
      the Barnstable Bank, I have long known as a sterling, sound,
      matter-of-fact man, whose judgment in what falls under his own
      observation is not easily misled. Mr. Otis (aside from the local
      papers) made the first published statement of the history and
      finding of the wreck. He saw the wreck on the beach, as did also
      Dr. Seabury, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>Mr. Drew, and many others, some of whom I know
      personally, and others by reputation. I have no hesitation in
      affirming my belief, that if human testimony can prove anything,
      the wreck you are now exhibiting on the Common, and which I have
      seen, was washed out of the Potanumaquut meadows in 1863. That is
      enough to establish beyond cavil the antiquity of the wreck. I
      need not recapitulate the historical statements set forth in your
      pamphlet,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> “The Ancient Wreck:” to my mind, they seem to point
      unmistakably to this very wreck, as that of the vessel spoken of
      by Morton and Prince, and to which tradition has assigned the name
      of “Sparrow-Hawk.” Bradford, who gives full particulars of the
      voyage and loss, omitted to mention the name of the vessel. Within
      a few years much light has been thrown on the period of English
      emigration to the colonies; and it is not improbable that we may
      yet learn from English records the name of the ship which Captain
      Johnston commanded, and in which Messrs. Fells and Sibsie were
      passengers. The name, however, is of little consequence, compared
      with the identity of the ship,—and that, I think, is clearly
      established by the historical facts as given in your publication
      to which I have alluded. Eminent ship-builders who have examined
      the frame as now exhibited, are clearly of opinion that it dates
      far back in the history of naval architecture. This fact furnishes
      additional evidence corroborative of the opinions I have expressed
      above.</p>

    <p>Hoping that your exhibition will be eminently successful,</p>

      <div style="text-align: right; margin-right: 8em;">I remain your ob’t ser’t,</div>

    <p><i>Dear Sirs</i>,—I have visited the old wreck, on exhibition, and
      although I have not had leisure to examine into its history, yet,
      as an amateur ship-builder, I am fully convinced these remains are
      of very ancient date, and not a humbug.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>
  <p>At the last (October, 1865,) meeting of the Massachusetts Historical
    Society, the subject of the “old wreck” being under discussion,
    Mr. Charles Deane read the following paper, which he had prepared
    to show the small size of some of the “ships” used in crossing the
    Atlantic, both before and at the time the vessel which we call the
    “Sparrow-Hawk,” was stranded on Nauset Beach. Mr. Deane remarked that
    the list could have been much extended:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Columbus had, on his first voyage of discovery, three vessels.
      “Two of them were light barks, called Caravels, not superior to
      river and coasting craft of more modern days.” They are supposed
      to have been open, “and without deck in the centre, but built up
      high at the prow and stern, with forecastles and cabins for the
      accommodation of the crew. Peter Martyr, the learned contemporary
      of Columbus, says that only one of the three vessels was decked.
      The smallness of the vessels was considered an advantage by
      Columbus, in a voyage of discovery, enabling him to run close to
      the shores, and to enter shallow rivers and harbors. In his third
      voyage, when coasting the Gulf of Paria, he complained of the
      size of his ship, being nearly a hundred tons burthen.” (Irving’s
      Columbus, Chap. VIII.)</p>

    <p>These three small vessels, only one of which was expressly prepared
      for the voyage, and was decked (the exact tonnage of neither is
      given), carried a company of one hundred and twenty persons,
      including ninety mariners.</p>

    <p>On Sir Francis Drake’s voyage for circumnavigating the globe,
      in 1577, his largest vessel was of only <i>one hundred</i> tons
      burthen, and the smallest but <i>fifteen</i> tons. The bark in
      which Sir Humphrey Gilbert perished, in 1583, was of <i>ten</i>
      tons only.</p>

    <p>Martin Pring made a voyage here in 1603, with two vessels,—one
      of <i>fifty</i> tons, carrying <i>thirty</i> men, and one of
      <i>twenty-six</i> tons, carrying <i>thirteen</i> men.</p>

    <p>Bartholomew Gilbert came over to the southern part of Virginia the
      same year, in a bark of <i>fifty</i> tons.</p>

    <p>Champlain and Pontgravé sailed for Canada, in the early part of the
      seventeenth century, with two vessels, of only <i>twelve</i> and
      <i>fifteen</i> tons.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

    <p>On the voyage to Virginia, which resulted in the first permanent
      settlement of the English in the United States, in 1607, the three
      vessels which conveyed the colonists, were <i>jointly</i> but
      of one hundred and sixty-tons; viz., the “Susan Constant,” the
      Admiral, of <i>one hundred tons</i>, carrying <i>seventy-one</i>
      persons; the “Godspeed,” the Vice-Admiral, of only <i>forty</i>
      tons, with <i>fifty-two</i> persons; the “Discovery,” the pinnace,
      of only <i>twenty</i> tons, with <i>twenty-one</i> persons. This
      number of persons included the mariners.</p>

    <p>Two of the ships with which Captain John Smith set sail for
      New England, in 1615, were, respectively, of <i>fifty</i> and
      <i>sixty</i> tons.</p>

    <p>In a list of ships which sailed for Virginia in 1619, I find one of
      <i>seventy</i> tons, carrying <i>fifty-one</i> persons, and one of
      <i>eighty</i> tons, with <i>forty-five</i> persons.</p>

    <p>The “Mayflower” was of “nine score” (180) tons burthen. The
      “Speedwell,” which brought the pilgrims from Holland to
      Southampton, and which was also intended for the voyage to America,
      but proved unseaworthy, was of <i>sixty</i> tons burthen. The
      “Fortune,” which brought <i>twenty-nine passengers</i> to Plymouth
      in 1621, was of only <i>fifty-five</i> tons. The “Little James,”
      which came in 1623, was of only <i>forty-four</i> tons.</p>

    <p>It is a marvel to us that persons were willing to venture across
      the stormy Atlantic, at all seasons of the year, in such small
      craft; and a still greater marvel that so many of these voyages
      were successfully accomplished.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Boston Congregationalist, of Oct. 20, 1865, publishes a condensed
    history of the voyage, wrecking, and discovery of the old ship, and
    adds:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“We advise all our readers who can make it convenient to do so, to
      visit this relic of our Colonial history, and to do so soon, before
      its removal from its present place. There is not the slightest
      doubt among the well-informed that she is all which is claimed
      for her by her exhibitors, no facts of the past being better
      authenticated than her record. Even such an imperfect reproduction
      as this is, of a ship which crossed the ocean while the Mayflower
      was yet on the sea, is a curiosity, to be seen, we take it, nowhere
      else in the world.”</p>

      incorrect. The charred surface of plank was found in close contact
      with timbers which had not been burned at all. The inference is, that
      the plank was partially charred, while being heated for the purpose of
      bending it,—the modern process of steaming, not having yet come into
      vogue.
  </div>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> This was not to be, however. For, a few months after, the
      capricious sea exhumed her once more, when the wreck was removed beyond
      and above high-water mark.

    <p>In the winter of 1860–61, in a storm, a new channel of sufficient
      depth for fishing-boats to pass out and in, opened in the beach, a
      short distance south of where the wreck lay. Through this channel the
      tide ebbed and flowed; and such was its effect on the currents that a
      cove or indentation was made in the beach nearly opposite the grave of
      the Sparrow-Hawk. This indentation became deeper and deeper, until at
      length the hull revisited the glimpses of the day. At the time of this
      writing, the channel and the cove have disappeared; in their place is
      a straight line of sea-beach, and there are ten feet of sand where the
      old vessel lay. But for this accidental opening and consequent abrasion
      of the beach, the vessel might, indeed, have remained “undiscovered for
      ages.”</p>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> The first recorded division of these meadows was in
        1750.—The inference is that they were in process of formation up to
        that time, but had not become valuable for mowing until that date.

      <p>The salt-meadows have a certain frontage along the beach, the
        boundaries being usually a stake and stones. These are occasionally
        found outside the beach, which has travelled inland. Leander Crosby,
        Esq., found one of these, a cedar stake, where the tide ebbed and
        flowed. It was marked with the initials, “R. S.” Doubtless, Richard
        Sparrow.</p>
